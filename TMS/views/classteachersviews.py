Class Teachers Views Module

This module contains views specifically designed for class teachers to manage student results
and perform result computations. It handles both termly and annual result management including
data entry, computation, and publication.

Key Features:
- Term-based result computation and management
- Annual result computation across all terms
- Student result data entry and updates
- Result publication and unpublication
- Grade and position calculation

Dependencies:
- SRMS.models: Student and academic data models
- TMS.models: Teacher and result management models
- Django authentication and JSON handling
